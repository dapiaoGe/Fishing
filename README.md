This study leverages a public AIS dataset focused on classifying three primary fishing activities: gillnetting, purse seining, and trawling. The dataset comprises authentic historical vessel trajectory data from the East China Sea, encompassing multiple dimensions such as vessel ID, latitude, longitude, speed, heading, timestamp, and operational mode. The dataset, available at [Baidu AI Studio](https://aistudio.baidu.com/datasetdetail/146541), includes 14,656 training samples and 3,664 test samples, with a balanced distribution of positive and negative samples.
